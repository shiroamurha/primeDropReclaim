Export your own session cookies on gaming.amazon.com. I used a extension called EditThisCookie, it's very easy to use, just select the extension icon on the top of the browser (alerady inside the gaming amazon page), click on "export cookies", then paste it on cookies.json.
<h3>Step 3:</h3>
Run Drop Manager 2.0.exe at the same directory as cookies.json
